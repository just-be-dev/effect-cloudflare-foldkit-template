# Effect · Cloudflare · Foldkit template

A starter for TypeScript apps on Cloudflare, built with Effect 4, Foldkit, Bun, mise, and Alchemy v2.

It comes with a Foldkit counter page, a small Effect service, a `GET /api/health` route, and an Alchemy stack with two Workers: a Website that serves the UI and an API. Both Workers send logs and traces to Workers Observability, and the API's Effect spans show up in Cloudflare's trace view.

```sh
mise trust && mise install
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run test && bun run format:check
bun run build
mise run dev
```

`mise run dev` prints a Website URL. The UI is served there, and `/api/*` is forwarded to the API Worker, which also has its own workers.dev URL. `GET /api/health` returns `{ "name": "Project starter", "status": "ok" }`. Unknown API routes return a JSON 404.

Root files configure Bun, mise, TypeScript, Vite, Oxlint/Oxfmt, foldcn, the Foldkit DevTools MCP server, and dependency patches.

## Starting a new project

1. Click **Use this template → Create a new repository** and pick the new repository's visibility.
2. Decide on the product's domain names, who owns which data, how users authenticate, and whether you need D1, Durable Objects, or AI.
3. Rename things: `name` in `package.json`, the `project-starter` stack in `src/platform/cloudflare/stack.ts`, the app name in `src/platform/cloudflare/api.ts`, and the page title and content in `index.html` and `src/ui/`. Resource names stick once deployed, so settle them before the first deploy.
4. Run `mise trust && mise install`, then `bun install --frozen-lockfile`. Commit `bun.lock`. Read the [tooling guide](docs/tooling.md) before upgrading dependencies.
5. Replace the sample service and counter with your first real feature. Keep Cloudflare code in `src/platform/cloudflare/` and runtime boot in `src/ui/entry.ts`.
6. Add your product's invariants to `AGENTS.md`, rewrite this README, and run the [checks](docs/guardrails.md).

A prompt for an agent: "Read AGENTS.md and docs/. Adapt this starter for an application that does [product description]. Keep the stack and boundaries. Build one useful vertical slice and verify it locally. Do not deploy."

## Deploying

Set up a Cloudflare profile with `bun alchemy profile edit --add Cloudflare`, or point `ALCHEMY_PROFILE` at an existing one. `mise run deploy` deploys the `prod` stage. The first deploy may offer to create Cloudflare-hosted Alchemy state.

Both Workers are public. The API answers on its workers.dev URL and through the Website's service binding, so any authentication you add has to cover both.

## Telemetry

Both Workers persist invocation logs and traces with a sampling rate of `1`, so every request is recorded. The API also provides `Cloudflare.Telemetry({ headSamplingRate: 1, persist: true })`, which exports the `Api.request` span and any `Effect.withSpan` or `Effect.fn` spans to Cloudflare.

After a deploy, request `/api/health` and open **Workers & Pages → App / Api → Observability**. Lower the sampling rates in `stack.ts` and `api.ts` once traffic grows. The [Cloudflare guide](docs/cloudflare.md) has the details.
