# Organization

The starter keeps the backend flat in `src/model.ts`, `src/service.ts`, and `src/api.ts`, with Cloudflare code in `src/platform/cloudflare/` and the frontend in `src/ui/`. As the project grows, it can take roughly this shape. Create folders when there's code to put in them.

## Dependency direction

```text
Cloudflare host ──→ HTTP/application ──→ domain models + capability contracts
       │                                      ▲
       └── selects adapters/layers ────────────┘

UI entry ──→ root ──→ page Submodels ──→ shared UI/domain leaves
```

HTTP code knows nothing about Cloudflare binding names or headers. Platform hosts provide the services it uses. Backend code imports from the owning domain directly. Add a barrel file when something consumes it, such as the frontend importing domain models.

Pages never import the root app; they talk to the parent through Messages and OutMessages. A small app can keep its pure definitions in `main.ts` and split `model`, `message`, and `command` out as they grow. Runtime boot always stays in `entry.ts` so tests can import definitions without starting the app.

Name domains after the product and document their invariants in `AGENTS.md`.

`boundary.test.ts` is a simple source-text check. It catches relative imports into `platform/`, the Alchemy, Cloudflare, and `agents` packages, and a list of Cloudflare global types. Extend it when you add backend path aliases, `.tsx` files, or other platform SDKs.
